This is a Django application built using pipenv (python virtualenv manager tool).

## Getting Started

To develop locally, run the following commands-

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Your Django API should now be running locally (0.0.0.0:8000) and is ready for development
